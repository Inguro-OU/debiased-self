# Manifesto

## 1. What Is a Meme

Humans naturally copy behaviors, ideas, and patterns from each other—like children imitating words or actions. This copying forms the basis of **memetic theory**, a scientific explanation of how culture spreads and evolves.

Most people think of “memes” as just jokes or GIFs. These are memes, but they’re only the most obvious examples—like the bright and visible sun blinding us from seeing the stars. In this case, the stars are the countless memes we copy daily, big and small. Every interaction with another person involves memes: **words, ideas, behaviors, traditions, or even practical knowledge like driving a car or generating electricity.**

From our perspective, it feels like we actively choose to copy memes. But like in Einstein’s theory of relativity, there’s another way to see it: from the meme’s perspective. Memes “move” through the world, seeking survival. A useful meme—like how to cook food or build a house—spreads because it helps people. A fun meme spreads by entertaining, like a joke or a dance. 

Like genes in biological evolution, memes replicate, mutate, and compete for attention and adoption in the ecosystem of human minds. We naturally adopt memes from those we trust and admire, leading to their propagation through social networks. Understanding meme transmission is key to controlling their impact.

## 2. What are Cognitive Biases

Every person has more than 200+ cognitive biases - predictable judgment errors encoded in our System 1 (fast thinking) through evolution. You can think of biases as useful memes for hundreds of thousands of years, and so they have become encoded in our human nature. All people are born with these biases. Arguably that the most dangerous self-reinforcing triad of biases are: 

1. Confirmation bias makes us seek evidence supporting our existing beliefs,
2. Myside bias evaluates evidence based on group identity rather than merit
3. Naïve realism convinces us we see objective reality while others are biased. 

These and other biases operate below conscious awareness and feel natural even as they strengthen harmful memes and resist correction.  

## 3. Everyone Makes Mistakes

This universal truth forms the foundation of effective debiasing: human intuition is imperfect. We all have cognitive biases, so we all make mistakes. The most dangerous mistake is assuming that any person, organization, idea, behavior, or cultural pattern is beyond error. Acknowledging your own and others’ fallibility paves the way for continuous learning, improvement, and effective debiasing.

## 4. There Are No Evil People, Only Evil Memes

From the meme’s perspective, the world is a playground where survival means being adopted and shared. Memes with **high fitness** spread easily, whether they benefit humanity (like the idea of human rights) or harm it (like false or harmful beliefs). Dangerous or “evil” memes thrive when they offer short-term advantages to individuals or groups but harm humanity in the long run.

By understanding memes, we shift the blame from individuals to the harmful ideas and thoughts they carry. Mark Twain summed it well: *“The problem isn’t that we know too little—it’s that we know things that aren’t true.”*

Mistrust emerges as a natural defense mechanism against people who might carry harmful or “evil” memes. However, mistrust is a **negative multiplier** on our ability to solve problems together. It blocks the creation of new knowledge and sharing valuable ideas, leaving problems unsolved and suffering unaddressed.

## 5. Two Cognitive Systems

The **System 1 and System 2** framework explains two complementary modes of human cognition:

- **Fast Thinking (System 1):** Automatic, habitual, and effortless—ideal for routine tasks and quick decisions.
    - **Memetic Role:** System 1 stores and reinforces existing memes—habits, ideas, and cultural patterns that define the self. It favors memes that fit with what is already known, resisting those that challenge the current status quo.
- **Slow Thinking (System 2):** Analytical, deliberate, and effortful—used for solving complex problems and questioning assumptions.
    - **Memetic Role:** System 2 enables creating, selecting, and adopting memes that offer long-term benefits but may conflict with existing beliefs or habits.

## 5. Local vs. Global Fitness and Meme Evolution

The **fitness of a meme** depends on how well its interests align:

- **Local Fitness:** A meme has high local fitness if its interests align with those of an individual or group, often providing short-term or localized benefits.
    - **Example in Time:** A lying meme might help someone avoid immediate consequences but erodes trust over time, causing harm to relationships.
    - **Example in Space:** A warlike meme may help a group gain power or resources, but as it spreads, it destabilizes societies, spreading conflict and destruction.
- **Global Fitness:** A meme has high global fitness if its interests align with humanity’s long-term well-being, fostering sustainable progress and cooperation.
    - **Example:** The meme of human rights aligns with global fitness because it promotes fairness and dignity, benefiting individuals while improving societal harmony.

Fast Thinking (System 1) ensures stability by maintaining local “fit” memes, while Slow Thinking (System 2) drives progress by fostering globally beneficial memes. Strengthening System 2 allows us to deliberately evolve ideas aligned with humanity’s long-term interests, overcoming System 1’s bias toward the familiar.

The **natural selection of memes** means people tend to adopt memes with high local fitness—those that fit into their culture, existing knowledge, or short-term interests. However, this often leads to the spread of harmful or "evil memes" that prioritize local benefits while causing broader harm.

The game helps with a shift to the **evolution of memes through humanistic selection**, which promotes memes with high global fitness. By doing so, we align cultural evolution with humanity’s collective long-term interests. This approach is central to the game, helping players practice and spread behaviors that foster trust, creativity, and progress for all.

## 6 How The Game Helps To Identify and Eliminate Evil Memes

In memetics theory, ideas evolve like genes—through **replication, mutation, and selection**. We introduce three core alter egos in the game: **Emo**, **Ratio** and **Creo (see game rules).**

- Emo - Emotional (right) part of the brain. Stay metaphorically speaking for the trait of cognitive empathy and active listening behavior. In memetics theory, it is responsible for accurate meme replication.
- Ration - Rational (left) part of the brain. Stays metaphorically speaking for the trait of Intellectual Humility and the corresponding behavior of critical thinking. In memetics theory, it is responsible for meme selection.
- Creo - Creative part of our brain. Stays metaphorically speaking for the trait of Openness and the behavior of improvisation. In memetics theory, it is responsible for meme mutation.

We suggest System 2 (slow thinking) encompasses all three alter egos above. By strengthening the main parts responsible for the memes' replication, selection, and mutation, we can accelerate meme evolution. In particular, instead of relying on meme evolution through natural selection, we can upgrade to meme evolution through humanistic selection. 

## 7. Debiasing Is a Human Right

Humanity as a whole knows which memes are evil, but individuals often lack access to this collective wisdom. With good ideas and the right knowledge (memes), most of our problems are solvable.

Debiasing in the sense of eliminating evil memes is a human right. No one should be left to struggle with harmful biases alone. It’s our moral obligation—if we can, and it’s cost-effective—to help each other weed out bad ideas.

Living with cognitive biases creates cascading harm:

- Individuals suffer through poor decisions
- Society is damaged through broken relationships
- Everybody suffers more because problems remain unresolved

Just as we recognize food security as a human right because hunger causes unnecessary suffering, we must recognize debiasing as a human right because cognitive biases cause unnecessary suffering. The cost of helping others debias is minimal compared to the massive benefits generated.

## 8. Vision: A World Where Violations of The Silver Rule Are Rapidly Decreasing

- **Our vision** is a world where violations of the Silver Rule—'Do not treat others in ways you don't want to be treated'—are increasingly rare, even among people across different cultures and large distances.
- **Our goal** is to lower the cost of assessing cognitive trustworthiness, an individual's ability to act with moral and epistemic impartiality, demonstrated through trust behaviors like promise-keeping, active listening, critical thinking, transparency, and long-term thinking. We also aim to increase incentives for people to increase their objective cognitive trustworthiness by allowing them to build lasting reputations and making adherence to the Silver Rule more beneficial than its violation.
- **Outcome**: As cognitive trustworthiness grows, individuals will more effectively correct their cognitive biases and prevent the spread of harmful patterns of thought and behavior ('evil memes'). Eradicating these evil memes more effectively will create a world of greater prosperity, happiness, progress, and equality.
