[README](https://github.com/Inguro-OU/debiased-self/blob/main/README.md) to learn more about the game, benefits, and background.

## 1. What Is a Meme

Humans naturally copy behaviors, ideas, and patterns—like children imitating words or actions. This copying forms the basis of [**memetic theory**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memetics), which explains how culture spreads and evolves.

Most people think of memes as jokes or GIFs, but these are the most visible examples. Memes include **words, ideas, thoughts, traditions, behaviors, and practical knowledge**—from driving a car to generating electricity. Every interaction involves memes, shaping our thoughts and actions.

We often believe we choose which memes to adopt, but memes behave like **self-replicating entities**, competing for survival in human minds. A useful meme—like how to cook food—spreads because it helps people. A fun meme spreads through entertainment, like a joke or dance.

Like genes in biological evolution, memes **replicate, mutate, and compete** for attention and adoption. We naturally adopt memes from those we **trust** and **admire**, reinforcing their spread. Understanding meme transmission helps us **control their impact**—whether positive or harmful.

## 2. What are Cognitive Biases

Humans are wired with over [**200 cognitive biases**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases)—systematic errors in judgment shaped by evolution. Three of the most dangerous, self-reinforcing biases are:

•	**Confirmation Bias** – Seeking evidence that supports our existing beliefs.

•	**Myside Bias** – Evaluating ideas based on group identity rather than merit.

•	**Naïve Realism** – Assuming we see reality objectively, while others are biased.

These biases operate **below conscious awareness**, making harmful memes feel natural and resistant to correction.

## 3. Everyone Makes Mistakes

The foundation of effective debiasing is recognizing human imperfection. We all have cognitive biases, meaning **we all make mistakes**. The most dangerous mistake is assuming any **belief, tradition, or ideology is beyond error**.

Acknowledging our fallibility creates space for **continuous learning, improvement, and critical thinking**—key tools for resisting harmful memes.

## 4. Three Types of Meme Fitness

A meme’s ability to spread is called its **fitness**. It can be categorized into three types:

- **Classical Meme Fitness** – A meme survives by replicating itself widely, whether beneficial or not.
- **Local Meme Fitness** – A meme benefits an individual or group but may harm others.
    - **Example in Time**: A lying meme may help someone avoid immediate consequences (e.g., deceit in politics).
    - **Example in Space**: A warlike meme may help a group gain power but cause broader harm (e.g., xenophobia).
- **Global Meme Fitness** – A meme benefits humanity in the long run.
    - **Example**: The meme of **human rights** aligns with global fitness.

Understanding meme fitness helps us **filter out harmful memes** while promoting those aligned with long-term well-being.

## 5. There Are No Evil People, Only Harmful Memes

From a meme’s perspective, survival depends on being **adopted and spread**. Some memes thrive because they benefit humanity (e.g., human rights), while others spread despite being **harmful** (e.g., false beliefs, divisive ideologies).

Harmful memes have **high local fitness and negative global fitness**, meaning they offer **short-term advantages** to individuals or groups but harm humanity in the long run. As Mark Twain noted, *“The problem isn’t that we know too little—it’s that we know things that aren’t true.”* False beliefs persist because they are **easier to adopt than challenge**.

By shifting blame from individuals to the **harmful memes they carry**, we can focus on eliminating destructive patterns of thought and behavior rather than vilifying people.

## 6. Role of Two Cognitive Systems in Memetics

The [**System 1 and System 2** framework from Kahneman and Tversky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow) explains two complementary modes of human cognition:

- **Fast Thinking (System 1):** Efficient, automatic, habitual, and effortless—ideal for routine tasks and quick decisions. Responsible brain regions: amygdala, ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), and basal ganglia
    - **Memetic Role:** System 1 stores and reinforces existing memes within individuals. These memes include habits, ideas, and cultural patterns that define the self. Fast thinking favors memes that fit well with what is already known and resists those that challenge the status quo.
- **Slow Thinking (System 2):** Flexible, analytical, deliberate, and useful for solving complex problems with high uncertainty. Responsible brain regions: dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)
    - **Memetic Role:** System 2 enables the creation, selection, and adoption of memes that offer long-term benefits but may conflict with existing beliefs or habits. 

By strengthening **System 2 thinking**, we can shift from meme evolution through **egoistic selection** (favoring short-term, group-serving memes) to meme evolution through **humanistic selection** (promoting memes that benefit humanity).

## 7. How Do We Eliminate Harmful Memes

In memetics theory, ideas evolve through **replication, mutation, and selection**. We can accelerate this evolution by strengthening three key mental faculties represented by:

- **Active listening** – Represents **cognitive empathy** and **active listening**, ensuring accurate **meme replication**.
- **Critical thinking** – Represents **intellectual humility** and **critical thinking**, ensuring **meme selection**.
- **Improvization** – Represents **exploration of ideas** and enables **meme mutation**.

Together, **Active listening, Critical thinking, and Improvisation** form a practical framework for debiasing. Strengthening these faculties allows us to **reject harmful memes and create better ones**, accelerating the evolution of ideas that serve humanity.

## 8. How To Find Good Memes

Good memes are **anti-fragile**—the more they are challenged, the stronger they become. If an idea thrives despite intense scrutiny, it’s likely valuable. Like scientific theories, good memes **withstand falsification attempts** and make useful predictions. If disproving a meme fails despite rigorous effort, it signals truth and long-term utility. Bad memes collapse when exposed to evidence; good memes **adapt, persist, and illuminate reality**. Seeking truth means testing memes ruthlessly—only those that **benefit humanity, in the long run,** will shine.

## 9. Debiasing Is a Human Right

While humanity accumulates wisdom on which memes are harmful, individuals often lack access to this knowledge. With the right knowledge (good memes), most of our problems are solvable.

Debiasing should be considered a human right. Just as food security is a right because hunger causes suffering, access to debiasing tools is crucial because misinformation and bias also cause suffering.

Since the cost of helping others debias is minimal compared to the massive societal benefits, we have a moral obligation to make debiasing accessible to all.

## 10. Vision: A humanist Future Where Trust and Truth Flourish

- **Our vision** is a world where violations of the Silver Rule—“Do not treat others in ways you don’t want to be treated”—are increasingly rare, even across cultures and distances.
- **Our goal:**
    - **Lower the cost of assessing cognitive trustworthiness**—a person’s ability to think and act with moral and epistemic impartiality.
    - **Increase incentives for cognitive trustworthiness**—enabling people to build reputations based on promise-keeping, active listening, and critical thinking.
- **Outcome**: As cognitive trustworthiness grows, people will recognize and correct their cognitive biases, reducing the spread of harmful memes. This advances a humanist vision of progress, shared prosperity, and global cooperation.
