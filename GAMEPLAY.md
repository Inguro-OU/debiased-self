Read the [README](https://github.com/Inguro-OU/debiased-self/blob/main/README.md) to learn more about the game, benefits, and background.

## **Flexible Gameplay**

1. **Free Movement:** In events of any size, players can move freely between groups and engage in one-on-one or small-group discussions.
2. **Small Group:** A small group of participants can play while seated around a table.
3. **Casual Play Anytime:** Once familiar with the game, participants can call someone’s **ideal self-name** on the fly in any situation for constructive responses.

---

## **Three Difficulty Levels**

The game offers three levels of play to suit different group sizes and complexities:

1. **Basic Level:** Core rules for casual groups or first-time players.
2. **Intermediate Level:** Adds structure with moderators and optional tools like idea cards. Ideal for small groups around a table.
3. **Advanced Level:** Includes expanded mechanics (e.g., intellectual humility figures, trustworthiness points) for deeper insights and competitive play. Suited for small groups of experienced players.

## **Core Rules**

### **1. Voluntary Participation**

- **Ideal Self-Name**: Each player chooses a name representing their aspirational, unbiased self (e.g., “Zweistein,” “Dalai Mama,” “Kunfulius”).
- **Badges**: Players wear a badge with their ideal self-name to signal participation.
- **Opt-Out Anytime**: Players may remove their badge at any time to step away if they feel fatigued.

### **2. Reward Cognitive Empathy with Armbands**

1. **Starting Supply**: Each player begins with **5 armbands** symbolizing **cognitive empathy**—the ability to understand someone else’s thoughts and feelings.
2. **Rewarding Armbands**: Players can freely give an armband to anyone who makes a meaningful contribution.
3. **Anti-Hoarding Rule**: A player may hold a maximum of **10 armbands**. Any extras must be donated.

### **3. Voice Disagreements After Acknowledged Understanding**

1. **Disagreement Rule**: To disagree with Player B, Player A must **earn an armband** from B (via active listening or donation).
2. **Standard Penalty**: If Player A disagrees without first earning B’s armband, A must **pay 1 armband** to B.
3. **Zero-Armband Penalty**: A player with **0 armbands** who disagrees without having earned B’s armband incurs a **5-minute silence penalty**, increasing by 5 minutes for repeated violations.
4. **Purpose of Disagreement**: Players disagree to exchange knowledge and collectively discern if an idea is true or false.

### **4. Challenge Others to Show Cognitive Empathy**

- **Setup**: The challenger calls the challenged player by their **ideal self-name**.
- **Active Listening**: The challenged player paraphrases the challenger’s perspective and asks open-ended clarifying questions.
    - **Understanding Success**: If the challenger feels understood, they give the challenged player **1 armband**.
    - **Understanding Gap**: If the challenger still feels misunderstood, they keep the armband.

### **5. Voluntary Self-Challenge**

- Any player may **spontaneously paraphrase** another’s perspective or ask open questions.
- If the other player **feels understood**, they reward the self-challenger with **1 armband**.

### **6. Collective Celebration of Mistakes**

- Whenever a player makes a mistake, admits an error, changes stance, or acknowledges bias, other players offer a **short clap** or **give an armband** to celebrate the moment of intellectual humility.

---

## **Intermediate Rules (Optional)**

### **7. Idea Cards**

- A player draws a card from a shared game deck.
- The card introduces an **idea** for discussion. Players reflect on biases, asking: “How do I feel about this? Why? Could I be biased?”

### **8. Declare Your Stance With a Truth Figure**

- Players verbally declare their stance on the card (**True**, **False**, or **Don’t Know**) or move a **truth figure** to indicate their view.

### **9. Explain Your Opinion**

- Each player has a set time (e.g., 1 minute) to explain their reasoning.
- Players can change their stance anytime new insights emerge. This is celebrated as a **debiasing moment** with a collective clap.

### **10. Moderator Role**

- Ensures **time limits** (e.g., 1 minute per opinion explanation, 2 minutes for active listening challenges).
- Leads **Recognition Claps** for acknowledgments.
- Resolves disputes and clarifies rules.
- To introduce new players, the moderator can start with game cards number **0, 1, and 2** to explain the golden rule, cognitive empathy, and intellectual humility.
- Once experienced, moderators can improvise with book-specific discussions, new game decks, or modified rules (e.g., as a warm-up before the game starts, players could share a recent past mistake and take full responsibility without permission to justify it).

---

## **Advanced Rules (Optional)**

### **11. Bring Your Own Deck**

- Players may create their own cards and bring them to the game.
- Each card’s backside may list the topic.
- Players can choose to draw from another player’s deck instead of the main deck.
- We recommend using [this custom GPT to refine the logic of your ideas.](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-676ec9d174608191a176779173a7a9e2-idea-refiner-for-debiased-self)

### **12. Create Cards on the Fly**

- Rather than explaining opinions verbally, players can write them on a new card mid-game.
- Any card in play must have **at least one player** validating it as true. Otherwise, it goes to the **“Graveyard.”**
- Others can likewise declare their stance: **True**, **False**, or **Don’t Know** (via truth figures or verbally).
- Each player can **allow** or **prohibit** being mentioned by name in new cards (e.g., “Edward misunderstands the breadth of confirmation bias”).
- Success can be measured by the **quantity and quality of ideas** dismissed into the Graveyard.

### **13. Intellectual Humility Figures**

- Each player starts with **5 figures**, each representing intellectual humility.
- After discussing a card, players redistribute these figures to those other players who demonstrated intellectual humility (e.g., admitting error, seeking counter-evidence).

### **14. Scoring Player’s Trustworthiness**

1. **Rank by Raw Figures:** 
    - Count how many intellectual humility figures each player received.
    - Rank players from most to fewest figures.
2. **Weight Figures by Giver’s Rank:** 
    - **5 points** if from 1st place
    - **3 points** if from 2nd place
    - **2 points** if from 3rd place
    - **1 point** if from all others
3. **Calculate Final Scores:**
    - Sum the weighted value of all figures each player received.
    - *Optional:* Double the score of the 1st place player by raw figure count.

### **15. Competitive Team Play**

- Combine trustworthiness points within each team for friendly competitions.
- Encourages both collaboration and accountability.

### **16. Do Good by Ending With a Donation Game**

*Inspired by Peter Singer’s work on effective altruism, particularly his book **The Life You Can Save**.*

1. **Optional Donations:** Players may put money on the table as a pooled contribution (optional).
2. **Propose Charities:** Each player suggests a charity or cause to add to the list.
3. **Discuss and Vote:** Players discuss the options and then vote. Votes are weighted by **intellectual humility points** (as previously defined). **If no agreement is reached in 10 minutes**, the player with the **highest intellectual humility score** makes the final decision.
4. **Responsibility for Donation:** The player with the **highest intellectual humility score** ensures the donation is made or may delegate the task to someone else.
