## **Flexible Gameplay**

1. **Small Group:** A small group of participants can play while seated around a table.
2. **Casual 1-on-1:** Once familiar with the game, participants can call someone’s **ideal self-name** on the Fly for constructive responses.
3. **Events with Free Movement:** In events of any size, players can move freely between groups and engage in one-on-one or small-group discussions.

## **Three Difficulty Levels**

The game offers three levels of play to suit different group sizes and complexities:

1. **Basic Level:** Core rules for casual groups or first-time players.
2. **Intermediate Level:** Adds structure with moderators and optional tools like idea cards. Ideal for small groups around a table.
3. **Advanced Level:** Includes expanded mechanics (e.g., intellectual humility figures, trustworthiness points) for deeper insights and competitive play. Suited for small groups of experienced players.

## **Core Rules**

### **1. Voluntary Participation**

- **Ideal Self-Name**: Each player chooses a name representing their aspirational, unbiased self (e.g., “Zweistein,” “Dalai Mama,” “Kunfulius”).
- **Badges**: Players wear a badge with their ideal self-name to signal participation.
- **Opt-Out Anytime**: Players may remove their badge to pause playing the game if they feel fatigued.

### **2. Armbands as Rewards**

- **Starting Supply**: Each player begins with five **armbands** on their left hand.
- **Anti-Hoarding Rule**: A player may hold a maximum of **10 armbands**. Players must donate extra armbands.

### **3. Develop Cognitive Empathy**

1. **The left hand** symbolizes the trait “**Cognitive empathy**”—the ability to understand someone else’s thoughts and feelings.
2. **Reward Active Listening**: Players reward one armband from their left hand to the left hand of another person who successfully gave them the feeling of being understood.
3. **Wording:** Suggested wording for clarity: “*[Nickname], thanks for active listening*.”

### **4. Develop Intellectual Humility**

- **The right hand** symbolizes “**Intellectual humility**”—the willingness to acknowledge the limits of knowledge and the openness to new ideas or evidence, even when it challenges one’s beliefs.
- **Reward Intellectual Humility**: When a player wants to reward another for intellectual humility, they permit the transfer of an armband from the left hand to the right hand of another player.
- **Wording:** Suggested wording for clarity: “*[Nickname], thanks for critical thinking*.”

### **5. Disagreements After Understanding**

1. **Purpose of Disagreement**: Players disagree to exchange knowledge and collectively discern if an idea is true or false.
2. **Disagreement Rule**: To disagree with Player B, Player A must **earn an armband** from B (via active listening or donation).
3. **Standard Penalty**: If Player A disagrees without first earning B’s armband, A must **pay one armband** to B.
4. **Wording:** Suggested wording for clarity: “*[Nickname], sorry you seem to disagree before reaching an understanding*.”
5. **Zero-Armband Penalty**: A player with zero **armbands** who disagrees without having earned B’s armband incurs a **5-minute silence penalty**, increasing by 5 minutes for repeated violations.

### **6. Challenge Active Listening**

- **Setup**: The challenger calls the challenged player by their **ideal self-name**.
- **Active Listening**: The challenged player paraphrases the challenger’s perspective and asks open-ended clarifying questions.
    - **Understanding Success**: If the challenger feels understood, they give the challenged player one **armband**.
    - **Understanding Gap**: If the challenger feels misunderstood, they keep the armband.
- **Wording:** Suggested wording for clarity: “*[Nickname], sorry, you seem to disagree before reaching an understanding*.”

### **7. Voluntary Self-Challenge**

- Any player may **spontaneously paraphrase** another’s perspective or ask open questions.
- If the other player **feels understood**, they reward the self-challenger with one **armband**.

### **8. Celebration of Mistakes**

- Whenever a player makes a mistake, admits an error, changes their opinion, or acknowledges bias, other players say thanks, offer a **short clap** or **give an armband** to celebrate the moment of intellectual humility.

---

## **Intermediate Rules (Optional)**

### **8. Idea Cards**

- A player draws a card from a shared game deck.
- The card introduces an **idea** for discussion. Players reflect, thinking (to themselves): “Which biases might I have?”

### **9. Declare Opinion**

- Players verbally declare their opinion on the card. There are only three options: **True**, **False**, or **Don’t Know.**
- If played at the table, the group can use **truth figures** and place them on the right option, expressing their opinion visually for others to see. Only one truth figure is allowed per player per card.

### **10. Explain Opinion**

- If all players have the same opinion on a given idea, they can move to the next card without explaining their opinion.
- If players disagree, each player has a set time (e.g., 1 minute) to explain the reasoning behind their opinion.
- Players can change their opinion anytime, which they celebrate as a **debiasing moment** with collective recognition (e.g., a clap).

### **11. Moderator Role**

- Ensures **time limits** (e.g., 1 minute to explain an opinion, 2 minutes for active listening challenges).
- Leads **Recognition Claps** for acknowledgments.
- Resolves disputes and clarifies rules.
- To introduce new players, the moderator can start with game cards numbered **0, 1, and 2** to explain the value of the golden rule, cognitive empathy, and intellectual humility.
- Once experienced, moderators can improvise with topic-specific discussions, new game decks, and modified rules (e.g., as a warm-up before the game starts, players could celebrate sharing a recent past mistake while taking full responsibility for it without justifications).

## **Advanced Rules (Optional)**

### **12. Bring Your Deck**

- Players may create their own cards and bring them to the game.
- Each card’s backside may list the topic.
- Players can draw from another player’s deck instead of the main deck.
- Recommended tool: Use [Custom GPT to refine your ideas](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-676ec9d174608191a176779173a7a9e2-idea-refiner-for-debiased-self) before writing them on a card.

### **13. Create Cards on the Fly**

- Players can express their ideas by writing them on a new card mid-game.
- Any card in play must have **at least one player** validating it as true. Otherwise, it goes to the **“Graveyard.”**
- Others can declare their opinion **True**, **False**, or **Don’t Know** (via truth figures or verbally).
- Players can choose whether they **allow** or **prohibit** their name to appear on new cards (e.g., “Edward misunderstands confirmation bias”).

### **14. End Game With a Donation Card**

Inspired by Peter Singer’s work on effective altruism, we suggest that the moderator end the game with a Donation Card (from the game deck).

1. **Optional Donations:** Players may pool financial contributions of any size.
2. **Propose Charities:** Each player suggests a charity or cause.
3. **Discuss and Vote:** Players discuss and vote. For voting purposes, players can use their trustworthiness scores as **weights**. **If no agreement is reached within a dedicated time (e.g., 10 minutes),** the player with the **highest trustworthiness score** makes the final decision.
4. **Responsibility for Donation:** The player with the **highest intellectual humility score** is appointed and will be responsible for transferring the donation to the chosen charity on behalf of the group.

## **Mastery Rules (Optional)**

### **15. Cognitive Trust Figures**

- Use chess figures to represent **“Cognitive Trust” -** is grounded in moral and epistemic impartiality, enabling individuals to overcome short-term self-interest for long-term cooperation.
- Each player starts with five **pawns** marked as theirs (e.g., with color-coding)
- After the end of each round (before dismissing a card and moving to the next one), players redistribute their cognitive trust figures to other players.

### **16. Scoring Player’s Trustworthiness**

- **Cognitive Trustworthiness** is the capacity to inspire cognitive trust by earning a reputation through consistent and observable trust-building behaviors.
- **Truth figures carry** cognitive trustworthiness scores of their players - for visual purposes, players can write their score on a paper and attach it to their truth figures.
- **Score Calculation**:
    1. **Rank Players by Pawns:** Count total pawns for each player.
    2. **Award Top Players with Bonus Trust Figures:** 
        - 1st place: a rook and a knight
        - 2nd place, two knights
        - 3rd place: a knight
    3. **Calculate Scores:** 
        - Pawn: 1 point
        - Knight: 3 points
        - Rook: 5 points

### **17. Competitive Team Play**

- Combine trustworthiness points within each team for friendly competition.
