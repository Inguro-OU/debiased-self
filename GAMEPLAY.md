## **Core Rules**

### **1. Voluntary Participation**

- **Name tag**: Players wear a badge with their real name. The name tag can be a heart associated with System 1—intuitive, automatic, and fast thinking.
- **Game Badge**: Players wear to signal participation. The game badge displays three parts of their Alter-Egos:
    


![99](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/624baa33-3e05-4b71-b79f-0fdc9006e0a4)


- **Listen Actively** – The **emotional** (right) brain. Represents **cognitive empathy** and **active listening**, ensuring accurate **meme replication**.
- **Think Critically** – The **rational** (left) brain. Represents **intellectual humility** and **critical thinking**, ensuring **meme selection**.
- **Improvize** – The **creative exploration and improvization**. Represents **openness** and enables **meme mutation**.
  
- **Opt-Out Anytime**: Players may remove their game badge to pause playing the game if they feel fatigued.

### **2. Armbands as Rewards**

- **Starting Supply**: Each player begins with five **armbands** in their hand. Armbands can be considered as gifts from other players - they represent an opportunity for other [players to act as Case A from the statements we presented in the README.](https://github.com/Inguro-OU/war-of-memes/blob/main/README.md#three-behaviors-that-change-everything)
- **Anti-Hoarding Rule**: A player may hold a maximum of **10 armbands**. Players must donate extra armbands.

### **3. Cultivate Cognitive Empathy**

1. Players can initiate an *active listening* challenge by saying to another player **“Listen Actively + [Name].”** To make the challenge more visual, the challenger places an armband on the table, signaling that the challenged player can earn it.
2. **Reward Active Listening**: 
    - **Understanding Success**: If the challenger feels understood, give the challenged player one **armband**.
    - **Understanding Gap**: If the challenger feels misunderstood, they keep the armband.
3. **Suggested Wording**: *”[Name], thanks for actively listening.”*

### **4. Foster Intellectual Humility**

1. Players can initiate a critical thinking challenge by saying to another player, “**Think Critically + [Name]**.” To make it more visual, the challenger places an armband on the table as a potential reward.
2. **Reward Intellectual Humility:** If the challenged player openly considers being wrong, acknowledges mistakes, or adjusts their viewpoint, they earn the armband.
3. **Suggested Wording:** ”*[Name], thanks for thinking critically.*”

### **4. Cultivate Creativity**

1. Players can initiate an *improvisation* challenge by saying to another player **“Improvize + [Name].”** To make it more visual, the challenger places an armband on the table as a potential reward.
2. **Reward Creativity**: If the challenged player helps expand ideas, uncover new possibilities, or refine concepts collaboratively, they earn the armband.
3. **Suggested Wording**: *”[Name], thanks for your improvization.”*

### **5. Disagreements After Earning and Armband**

1. **Purpose of Disagreement**: Players disagree to exchange knowledge and collectively discern if an idea is true or false.
2. **Disagreement Rule**: To disagree with Player B, Player A must **earn an armband** from B on the given topic or obtain explicit permission to disagree without earning an armband.
3. **Standard Penalty**: If Player A disagrees without first earning B’s armband, A must **pay one armband** to B.
4. Suggested wording: “*[Name], sorry for disagreeing*.”
5. **Zero-Armband Penalty**: A player with zero **armbands** who disagrees without having earned B’s armband incurs a **5-minute silence penalty**, increasing by 5 minutes for repeated violations.

### **7. Voluntary Self-Challenge**

- Any player may **spontaneously challenge himself on any of the three aspects of the game**.
- If the other player **feels it**, they can reward the self-challenger with one **armband**.

### **8. Celebration of Mistakes**

- Whenever a player makes a mistake, admits an error, changes their opinion, or acknowledges bias, other players say thanks, offer a **short clap,** or **give an armband** to celebrate the moment of intellectual humility.

---

## **Intermediate Rules (Optional)**

### **9. Idea Cards**

- A player draws a card from a shared game deck.
- The card introduces an **idea** for discussion. Players reflect, thinking (to themselves): “Which biases might I have?”

### **10. Declare Opinion**

- Players verbally declare their opinion on the card. There are only two options: **True or** **False.** Players can withhold declaring their opinion, indicating their uncertainty.
- If played at the table, the group can use **truth figures** and place them on the right option, expressing their opinion visually for others to see. Only one truth figure is allowed per player per idea card.

### **11. Explain Opinion**

- If all players agree on a given idea, they can move to the next card without explaining their opinion.
- If players disagree, each player has a set time (e.g., 1 minute) to explain the reasoning behind their opinion.
- Players can change their opinion anytime, which they celebrate with collective recognition (e.g., a clap) as a debiasing moment.

### **12. Moderator Role**

- Ensures **time limits** (e.g., 1 minute to explain an opinion, 2 minutes for active listening challenges).
- Leads **Recognition Claps** for acknowledgments.
- Resolves disputes and clarifies rules.
- Once experienced, moderators can improvise with topic-specific discussions, new game decks, and modified rules (e.g., as a warm-up before the game starts, players could celebrate sharing a recent past mistake while taking full responsibility for it without justifications).

---

## **Advanced Rules (Optional)**

### **13. Bring Your Deck**

- Players may create their own cards and bring them to the game.
- Each card’s backside may list the topic.
- Players can draw from another player’s rather than the main deck.
- Recommended tool: Use [Custom GPT to refine your ideas](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-676ec9d174608191a176779173a7a9e2-idea-refiner-for-war-of-memes) before writing them on a card.

### **14. Create Cards on the Fly**

- Players can express their ideas by writing them on a new card mid-game. We recommend that each player create a new card if they disagree with a given idea to explain their position in a short, clear way.
- Any card in play must have **at least one player** validating it as true. Otherwise, it goes to the **“Graveyard.”**
- Others can declare their opinion **True or False** (via truth figures or verbally).
- Players can choose whether to **allow** or **prohibit** their name from appearing on new cards (e.g., “Edward misunderstands confirmation bias”).

### **15. End Game With a Donation Card**

Inspired by Peter Singer’s work on effective altruism, we suggest that the moderator end the game with a Donation Card (from the game deck).

1. **Optional Donations:** Players may pool financial contributions of any size.
2. **Propose Charities:** Each player suggests a charity or cause.
3. **Discuss and Vote:** Players discuss and vote. Players can use their trustworthiness scores as **weights**for voting purposes. **If no agreement is reached within a dedicated time (e.g., 10 minutes),** the player with the **highest trustworthiness score** makes the final decision.
4. **Responsibility for Donation:** The player with the **highest intellectual humility score** is appointed and will be responsible for transferring the donation to the chosen charity on behalf of the group.

## **Mastery Rules (Optional)**

### **16. Cognitive Trust Figures**

- Use chess figures to represent **“Cognitive Trust,” which** is grounded in moral and epistemic impartiality and enables individuals to overcome short-term self-interest for long-term cooperation.
- Each player starts with five **pawns** marked as theirs (e.g., with color-coding)
- After the end of each round (before dismissing a card and moving to the next one), players redistribute their cognitive trust figures to other players.

### **17. Scoring Player’s Trustworthiness**

- **Cognitive Trustworthiness** is the capacity to inspire cognitive trust by earning a reputation through consistent and observable trust-building behaviors.
- **Truth figures carry** the cognitive trustworthiness scores of their players. For visual purposes, players can write their scores on a piece of paper and attach them to their truth figures.
- **Score Calculation**:
    1. **Rank Players by Pawns:** Count total pawns for each player.
    2. **Award Top Players with Bonus Trust Figures:** 
        - 1st place: a rook and a knight
        - 2nd place, two knights
        - 3rd place: a knight
    3. **Calculate Scores:** 
        - Pawn: 1 point
        - Knight: 3 points
        - Rook: 5 points

### **18. Competitive Team Play**

- Combine trustworthiness points within each team for friendly competition.
