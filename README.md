# War of Memes

## There Are No Bad People, Only Bad Ideas. 
### Players Unite to Prove Harmful Real-World Ideas False Before They Turn People Against Each Other

War of Memes is a gamified **debiasing method** that helps individuals and teams reduce cognitive biases' negative impact—predictable judgment errors arising from our brains’ reliance on mental shortcuts. It fosters **cognitive empathy**, **intellectual humility**, **trustworthiness**, and **enhanced problem-solving capacity**. Players sharpen **active listening** and **critical thinking** skills through meaningful discussions and peer-initiated challenges while **exchanging knowledge** more effectively. Players collectively celebrate mistakes and grow closer to their **ideal, debiased selves**. War of Memes is adaptable to a variety of contexts and offers multiple benefits, including:

- **Conflict Resolution** – The game helps resolve epistemic (true vs. false) and moral (right vs. wrong) conflicts more effectively
- **Soft Skills, Sales, and Negotiation Training** – The game enhances essential people-focused skills like understanding and persuasion.
- **Self-Improvement** – The game reduces distortions in how you perceive yourself, others, and reality.
- **Peer-To-Peer Psychotherapy** – The game helps to overcome mental challenges and heal from past traumas.
- **Assess Truthwortiness and Accelerate Trust-Building** – Use the game in your hiring assessments and as a team-building exercise
- **Exchange Knowledge and Feedback More Effectively** – Game mechanics make knowledge exchange more effective. In particular, it helps to better give and receive feedback, make better decisions, and reduce predictable errors.
- **Enhance Collective Problem-Solving** – The game helps larger groups to cooperate and solve problems more effectively together.
