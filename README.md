# War of Memes: Gamified Debiasing Method
## Together We Prevent Tomorrow‚Äôs Errors Today. 

Harmful patterns of thought and behavior are among humanity‚Äôs greatest challenges. They create division, cause harm, and turn people against each other. This gamified debiasing method empowers players to work together to overcome these destructive patterns.

## Why Don‚Äôt We Experience What We Crave?

**Why do many people with wealth, power, or success still feel empty?** Why do statistics reveal that money doesn‚Äôt buy happiness?

The answer lies in something money can‚Äôt provide: **genuine connection, respect, and compassion**. These things make life truly meaningful but can‚Äôt be purchased or forced.

Psychologist **Abraham Maslow** captured this insight in his famous *Hierarchy of Needs*. He showed that after securing our basic **physiological** and **safety** needs, we strive for deeper fulfillment:

1. **Belonging and Love** ‚Äì Feeling truly connected, understood, and cared for.
2. **Esteem** ‚Äì Being recognized, valued, and respected by others.
3. **Cognitive Growth** ‚Äì Expanding ideas, seeking truth, and making sense of the world.

Think about it: **When did you last feel connected to someone?** When did you last feel deeply valued‚Äîor inspired to learn and grow?

These are **universal human needs**‚Äîeveryone craves them. Yet, despite their importance, most people **rarely experience true satisfaction** in these areas. Instead, we feel disconnected, overlooked, and misunderstood‚Äîeven by those closest to us.

## Everyone Craves It‚ÄîBut Rarely Gets It

Sadly, even those we trust the most‚Äîfriends, family, and colleagues‚Äîoften fail to meet our needs for belonging, esteem, and cognitive growth. Here‚Äôs the paradox: it‚Äôs not complex to meet these needs. Fulfilling them doesn‚Äôt require a scarce resource like money. In fact, **the more you share behaviors that satisfy these needs, the more you get in return‚Äîstrengthening both you and those around you**. The problem is that when these crucial needs aren‚Äôt met, life doesn‚Äôt just lose meaning‚Äîit becomes **far more difficult.**

### **1. Problems in Personal Life**

- Everyday challenges feel harder to solve, and mistakes pile up, chipping away your confidence.
- Earning potential slips as mental blocks and psychological barriers hold you back.
- Without feedback or support, essential soft skills‚Äîlike active listening, negotiation, or collaboration‚Äîstagnate or decline.

### **2. Problems in Social Life**

- Even close relationships suffer when others violate the ‚Äúsilver rule,‚Äù treating you in ways **they wouldn‚Äôt accept themselves**.
- Unresolved conflicts linger, often over what‚Äôs true or false, right or wrong.
- Trust becomes harder to build and maintain, creating a spiral of isolation and disconnection.

### **3. Problems at Work and in Teams**

- Collaboration suffers as knowledge-sharing and feedback loops disappear.
- Teams become mistrustful, making collective problem-solving slow and ineffective.
- Instead of the best ideas winning, the loudest voices or most powerful people dominate‚Äîstifling creativity and growth.

**But here‚Äôs the good news:** These problems aren‚Äôt inevitable. They result from **missing behaviors**‚Äîsimple, powerful actions anyone can learn and practice. 

## What Are These 3 Behaviors?

What are these **surprisingly simple** yet **powerful** behaviors that fulfill our deepest needs? We refer to them as **Case A** (when our needs are fulfilled) and **Case B** (when we feel hurt). As you read the statements below, consider:

1. Do you believe each of the 3 statements below is `true` or `false`?
2. How often do you personally experience **Case A** versus **B**?
3. How often do you let those around you experience **Case A** or **B**?

---
üëâ **Statement 1:** You like the same person more in case A rather than B:

- In case A, this person gives you the feeling that she understands your perspective.
- In case B, this person doesn‚Äôt answer, breaks communication, and intentionally ignores your perspective

---
üëâ **Statement 2:** You like the same person more in case A rather than B:

- In case A, this person easily admits the possibility of being wrong, easily recognizes her mistakes, and willingly changes her opinion when presented with objectively better evidence.
- In case B, this person refuses to admit the possibility of being wrong, denies or ignores her mistakes, and clings to her opinions even when faced with objectively better evidence.

---
üëâ **Statement 3:** You like the same person more in case A rather than B:

- Case A: This person helps you explore and expand your ideas, uncover new possibilities, and refine them together.
- Case B: This person dismisses your ideas, sticking rigidly to those already familiar to them, avoiding creative risks and limiting exploration.

## Player‚Äôs Benefits

By helping each other stay in **Case A** more often‚Äîand avoiding **Case B**‚Äîplayers unlock powerful advantages across three key areas:

8. Assess the objective trustworthiness of other people more effectively
9. Increase your capacity to trust others while minimizing the risk of being taken advantage of 

**Improve your impact**

10. Exchange knowledge and feedback more effectively
