# Debiasing Self

```bash
git clone <https://github.com/Inguro-OU/debiased-self.git
cd <debiased-self>
```

**Debiasing Self** is a gamified debiasing method that helps individuals and teams uncover cognitive biases—predictable errors in judgment arising from our brains’ reliance on mental shortcuts. It fosters **cognitive empathy**, **intellectual humility**, **trustworthiness**, and **enhanced problem-solving capacity**. Players sharpen **active listening** and **critical thinking** skills through meaningful discussions and peer-initiated challenges while **exchanging knowledge** more effectively. Players collectively celebrate mistakes and grow closer to their **ideal, debiased selves**. **Debiasing Self** is adaptable to a variety of contexts, including:

- **Conflict resolution -** Debiasing helps to overcome conflicts and agree on right and wrong, true and false
- **Soft skills / Sales / Negotiation training** – debiasing helps develop crucial people-oriented skills
- **Team-building** – debiasing promotes mutual trust within a team
- **Self-improvement** – debiasing helps you see yourself, others, and shared reality with fewer distortions
- **Psychotherapy** – debiasing supports overcoming mental problems and past traumas
- **Hiring assessments** – Debiasing Self can serve as a test to quickly assess a candidate’s trustworthiness and soft skills
- **Decision-making** – debiasing leads to better decisions and fewer predictable errors
