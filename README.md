# War of Memes: A Gamified Trust-Building Debiasing Method

## 🚀 Together, We Prevent Tomorrow’s Errors Today.

We all seek **connection, truth, and trust**, yet today’s world makes them harder to find. **Cognitive biases, miscommunication, and division** create barriers—at home, in the workplace, and across society.

**War of Memes** is not just a game—it’s a **humanist ritual** designed to sharpen **how we think, communicate, and cooperate.**

## Why Don’t We Experience What We Crave?

Beyond basic survival, humans crave:

🔹 **Belonging** – Feeling truly heard and understood.

🔹 **Respect** – Being valued for our ideas and contributions.

🔹 **Growth** – Expanding our knowledge and seeing reality more clearly.

Yet, despite their importance, many feel **isolated, unheard, and misunderstood**. Ironically, these needs are **not scarce resources**—the more we help others meet them, the more we gain ourselves. The problem? **Most people lack the habits that make this possible.**

Life doesn’t just lose meaning when these needs go unfulfilled **—it becomes exponentially harder.**

## **What Happens When These Needs Go Unmet?**

### 🛑 **Personal Challenges**

- Problems become harder to solve, mistakes accumulate, earning potential declines
- Self-doubt and mental blocks limit potential and growth.
- Soft skills—like active listening, negotiation, or collaboration—stagnate.

### 🛑  **Social Challenges**

- Relationships suffer when people violate the “silver rule,” treating others in ways they wouldn’t like to be treated themselves.
- Conflicts persist over what’s true or false, right or wrong.
- Misunderstanding becomes the norm, creating a spiral of isolation and disconnection.

### 🛑 **Work Challenges**

- Collaboration breaks down, knowledge-sharing and feedback loops disappear.
- Mistrust diminishes the collective problem-solving capacity.
- Instead of the best ideas winning, the loudest or most powerful voices dominate.

## Three Behaviors That Change Everything

What are these **surprisingly simple** yet **powerful** behaviors that fulfill our social needs? We refer to them as **Case A** (when our needs are fulfilled) and **Case B** (when we feel hurt). As you read the statements below, consider:

1. Do you believe each of the 3 statements below is `true` or `false`?
2. How often do you personally experience **Case A** versus **B**?
3. How often do you behave as  **Case A** or **B**?
4. Can you behave as in case A, even with people you don’t like or disagree with?



👉 **Statement 1:** Is it `true` or `false` that you would **like the same person more** in Case A than in Case B?

- In case A, this person gives you the feeling that she understands your perspective.
- In case B, this person doesn’t answer, breaks communication, and intentionally ignores your perspective


👉 **Statement 2:** Is it `true` or `false` that you would **like the same person more** in Case A than in Case B?

- In case A, this person easily admits the possibility of being wrong, easily recognizes her mistakes, and willingly changes her opinion when presented with objectively better evidence.
- In case B, this person refuses to admit the possibility of being wrong, denies or ignores her mistakes, and clings to her opinions even when faced with objectively better evidence.


👉 **Statement 3:** Is it `true` or `false` that you would **like the same person more** in Case A than in Case B?

- Case A: This person helps you explore and expand your ideas, uncover new possibilities, and refine them together.
- Case B: This person dismisses your ideas, sticking rigidly to those already familiar to them, avoiding creative risks and limiting exploration.

## **How War of Memes Helps You Win**

By reinforcing **Case A behaviors** and minimizing **Case B**, players unlock advantages across three domains:

🔹**Personal Gains**

1. Increase your problem-solving capacity and, as a result, your earnings potential 
2. Reduce the number of mistakes you make
3. Overcome your mental blocks and challenges more effectively 
4. Increase your objective trustworthiness
5. Improve your soft skills (e.g., active listening, communication, sales, negotiation, persuasion, critical thinking, and more)

🔹**Social Gains**

6. Help the people close to you reduce the number of times they violate the Silver Rule by treating you in ways they wouldn’t want to be treated themselves.
7. Resolve epistemic conflicts (about what’s true and false) and moral conflicts (about what’s right or wrong) more effectively
8. Assess the objective trustworthiness of other people more effectively
9. Increase your capacity to trust others while minimizing the risk of being taken advantage of 

🔹**Professional Gains**

10. Exchange knowledge and feedback more effectively
11. Accelerate trust-building between members of small and large teams
12. Enhance the problem-solving capacity of small and large teams
13. Spread the culture of idea meritocracy where the best ideas win regardless of their source

## **Beyond a Game: A Humanist Movement**

**Mistrust** is tearing at the fabric of our world, dividing societies, fueling conflict, and stifling progress. Challenges like **climate change**, **misinformation**, and **geopolitical tensions** demand an extraordinary response: **trust**. Without it, **cooperation collapses**, and humanity stagnates.

Trust is **transformative**—it restores connection, inspires action, and unlocks shared purpose. A future without trust is one of **scarcity** and **despair**, while a future with trust unlocks **progress and possibility**.

**War of Memes** is more than just a fun game—it’s a **ritual of a humanistic movement** that helps us find **truth, rebuild trust, and make genuine connections.**
