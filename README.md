# War of Memes: Debiasing Game - Break Free from Errors We're Born With

Evil memes - patterns of thought that divide us and cause harm - are humanity's greatest challenge. They turn people against each other, stifle progress, and multiply suffering. This manifesto explains how we can eliminate them through systematic debiasing.

## Your Benefits

Debiasing transforms you and your impact through ten key benefits:

### Mind & Self

1. Self-improvement and reduce the number of mistakes
2. Peer-to-peer psychotherapy and improved mental state
3. Improve soft skills like communication, sales, and negotiation

### Trust & Communication

1. Resolve epistemic (true/false) and moral (right/wrong) conflicts effectively
2. Assess the trustworthiness of individuals
3. Accelerate trust-building in teams and one-on-one
4. Exchange feedback more effectively

### Collective Progress

1. Exchange knowledge more effectively
2. Enhance collective problem-solving capacity
3. Foster idea of meritocracy where the best ideas win regardless of the source

# Manifesto

## 1. Everyone Makes Mistakes

This universal truth is the foundation of effective debiasing: We all make mistakes. The most dangerous mistake is believing any idea, behavior, or cultural pattern cannot possibly be wrong. Recognizing our fallibility opens the door to improvement.

## 2. Memes Live In Our Brains

A meme is a pattern of thought, behavior, or culture that spreads through human minds by imitation. Like genes in biological evolution, memes replicate, mutate, and compete for survival in the ecosystem of human minds. We naturally adopt memes from those we trust and admire, leading to their propagation through social networks. Understanding meme transmission is key to controlling their impact.

## 3. There Are No Evil People, Only Evil Memes

Memes vary in their fitness - their ability to survive and spread. The most dangerous memes combine high local fitness (benefiting individuals or small groups) with low global fitness (harming humanity's long-term interests when widely adopted). They persist through strong resistance to correction and rapid spread. This understanding shifts blame from individuals to ideas, enabling more effective solutions.

## 4. Cognitive Biases Reinforce Evil Memes

Every person has more than 200+ cognitive biases - predictable judgment errors encoded in our brains through evolution. The most dangerous self-reinforcing triad are: 

1. Confirmation bias makes us seek evidence supporting our existing beliefs,
2. Myside bias evaluates evidence based on group identity rather than merit
3. Naïve realism convinces us we see objective reality while others are biased. 

These biases operate below conscious awareness and feel natural even as they strengthen harmful memes and resist correction.

## 5. Mistrust Is a Defense Against Evil Memes

Mistrust emerges as a natural defense against evil memes. However, this defense mechanism becomes a fundamental negative multiplier of collective problem-solving capacity. It blocks knowledge creation by limiting information sharing and diversity of perspectives. It misaligns interests, encouraging short-term thinking over cooperation. It critically inhibits progress by preventing long-term planning and resource investment in scalable solutions.

## 6. Debiasing Eradicates Evil

Debiasing systematically reduces cognitive biases' impact, addressing three fundamental challenges for humanity: 

1. The **Hard Problem of Cooperation** is the challenge of fostering cooperation between agents—**individuals** or **groups**—where each can gain at the expense of others. Each agent pursuing their **own interests** often leads to **collective failure**.
2. The **Tragedy of the Commons** occurs when individuals overuse **public goods** or shared resources for personal gain, depleting them for everyone. Each person acts rationally in their own short-term interest, but collectively, this behavior leads to resource collapse, harming all. 
3. The Tragedy of Rationality occurs when actions rational for agents—individuals or groups—lead to irrational outcomes for the collective. 

## 7. Debiasing Is a Human Right

Living with cognitive biases creates cascading harm:

- Individuals suffer through poor decisions
- Society is damaged through broken relationships
- All humans suffer more because problems remain unresolved

Just as we recognize food security as a human right because hunger causes unnecessary suffering, we must recognize debiasing as a human right because cognitive biases cause unnecessary suffering. The cost of helping others debias is minimal compared to the massive benefits generated.

## 8. Vision: A World Where the Majority Respects the Silver Rule

The **Silver Rule**—“Do not treat others in ways you don’t want to be treated”—is the foundation of a better world. Yet today, most people violate it with both those near and far. The root cause is **evil memes**—**destructive patterns of thinking, behavior, and culture**—that divide us, harm us, and fuel crises like **climate change, resource depletion, nuclear proliferation, and disinformation**.

**Debiasing isn’t optional—evil memes are humanity’s greatest existential threat.**

Our vision is a world where **evil memes are eradicated before they spread**, and the majority of people respect the **Silver Rule**, even with those who are far or different from them.
