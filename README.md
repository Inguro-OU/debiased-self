# What is it? 

### TL;DR: A cognitively trustworthy communication method for evolving ideas that multiply everyone's happiness.

### More detailed explanation:

- **Trust** is a belief that someone or something is **worthy** of trust.  
- **Trustworthiness** is **actually being worthy** of that belief.  
- **Four Types of Trust**:
    1. **Cognitive Trust** – Based on fair treatment of people and ideas.  
    2. **Affective Trust** – Rooted in sympathy and similarity.  
    3. **Competence-Based Trust** – Built on proven skills and expertise.  
    4. **Institutional Trust** – Confidence in organizations, systems, and rules.  
- This method focuses on **cognitively trustworthy** communication—a way of interacting with others that them feel you are **actually worthy** of their **cognitive trust**.

### 🛑 **Personal Challenges**

- Problems become harder to solve, mistakes accumulate, earning potential declines
- Self-doubt and mental blocks limit potential and growth.
- Soft skills—like active listening, negotiation, or collaboration—stagnate.

### 🛑 **Social Challenges**

- Relationships suffer when people violate the “silver rule,” treating others in ways they wouldn’t like to be treated themselves.
- Conflicts persist over what’s true or false, right or wrong.
- Misunderstanding becomes the norm, creating a spiral of isolation and disconnection.

### 🛑 **Work Challenges**

- Collaboration breaks down, knowledge-sharing and feedback loops disappear.
- Mistrust diminishes the collective problem-solving capacity.
- Instead of the best ideas winning, the loudest or most powerful voices dominate.

## 8 Trust-Building Behaviors

What are these **surprisingly simple** yet **powerful** trust-building behaviors? We refer to them as **Case A** (when trust is built) and **Case B** (when trust is broken). As you read the statements below, consider:

1. How often do you personally experience **Case A** versus **B**?
2. How often do you behave as **Case A** or **B**?
3. Can you behave as in case A, even with people you don’t like or disagree with?

👉 **Statement 1:** Is it `true` or `false` that you would **like the same person more** in Case A than in Case B?

- In case A, this person gives you the feeling that she understands your perspective.
- In case B, this person doesn’t answer, breaks communication, and intentionally ignores your perspective

👉 **Statement 2:** Is it `true` or `false` that you would **like the same person more** in Case A than in Case B?

- In case A, this person readily admits the possibility of being wrong, easily recognizes her mistakes, and willingly changes her opinion when presented with objectively better evidence.
- In case B, this person refuses to admit the possibility of being wrong, denies or ignores her mistakes, and clings to her opinions even when faced with objectively better evidence.

👉 **Statement 3:** Is it `true` or `false` that you would **like the same person more** in Case A than in Case B?

- Case A: This person helps you explore and expand your ideas, uncover new possibilities, and refine them together.
- Case B: This person dismisses your ideas, sticking rigidly to those already familiar to them, avoiding creative risks and limiting exploration.

👉 **Statement 4:** Is it `true` or `false` that you would **like the same person more** in Case A than in Case B?

- Case A: This person keeps her promises despite her high cost.
- Case B: This person makes promises that she intends to break.

👉 **Statement 5:** Is it `true` or `false` that you would **like the same person more** in Case A than in Case B?

- Case A: This person tells you the truth despite her high cost.
- Case B: This person intentionally lies to you when it serves her interests.

👉 **Statement 6:** Is it `true` or `false` that you would **like the same person more** in Case A than in Case B?

- **Case A:** This person looks decades ahead and considers the long-term effects of her actions
- **Case B:** This person doesn’t look ahead and ignores the long-term effects of her actions.

👉 **Statement 7:** Is it `true` or `false` that you would **like the same person more** in Case A than in Case B?

- **Case A:** This person looks decades ahead and considers the long-term effects of her actions
- **Case B:** This person doesn’t look ahead and ignores the long-term effects of her actions.

👉 **Statement 8:** Is it `true` or `false` that you would **like the same person more** in Case A than in Case B?

- **Case A:** This person empowers people to treat others how they want to be treated themselves.
- **Case B:** This person ignores when people treat each other in ways they **would not** want to be treated.

## **Your Benefits**

By reinforcing **Case A trust-building behaviors** and minimizing **Case B's trust-breaking behaviors**, participants unlock advantages across three domains:

🔹**Personal Gains**

1. Increase your problem-solving capacity and, as a result, your earnings potential
2. Reduce the number of mistakes you make
3. Overcome your mental blocks and challenges more effectively
4. Increase your objective trustworthiness
5. Improve your soft skills (e.g., active listening, communication, sales, negotiation, persuasion, critical thinking, and more)

🔹**Social Gains**

1. Help the people close to you reduce the number of times they violate the Silver Rule by treating you in ways they wouldn’t want to be treated themselves.
2. Resolve epistemic conflicts (about what’s true and false) and moral conflicts (about what’s right or wrong) more effectively
3. Assess the objective trustworthiness of other people more effectively
4. Increase your capacity to trust others while minimizing the risk of being taken advantage of

🔹**Professional Gains**

1. Exchange knowledge and feedback more effectively
2. Accelerate trust-building between members of small and large teams
3. Enhance the problem-solving capacity of small and large teams
4. Spread the culture of idea meritocracy where the best ideas win regardless of their source

## Trustworthy Community

Trust-building communication is more than a skill—it’s the foundation of a **trustworthy community.** Membership in such a community requires individuals to:

- **Treat fellow members as you wish to be treated—by practicing Case A trust-building behaviors.**
- **Refrain from treating outsiders in ways you wouldn’t want to be treated—by avoiding Case B trust-breaking behaviors.**
