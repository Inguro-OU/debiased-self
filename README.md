**TL;DR**: With this method you can **predictably increase the chance** of experiencing **trustworthy communication & behaviors** and **decrease the chance** of experiencing **untrustworthy communication & behaviors**. 

So, what are these simple but powerful habits for trustworthy communication and behaviors?

**Three Simple Habits for Trustworthy Communication**:

Imagine a particular college friend, partner, family member, or stranger. Do you **agree** or do you **disagree** with the following seven statements? 

👉1. **Active Listening:** Your college, friend, family member, or stranger is:

- **More worthy** of your trust when they give you the feeling that they understand your perspective.
- **Less worthy** of your trust when they don’t answer, break communication, and intentionally ignore your perspective

👉2. **Critical Thinking:** Your college, friend, family member, or stranger is:

- **More worthy** of your trust when they admit the possibility of being wrong, recognize their mistakes, and change their opinion when presented with objectively better evidence.
- **Less worthy** of your trust when they refuse to admit the possibility of being wrong, deny or ignore her mistakes, and cling to her opinions even when faced with objectively better evidence.

👉3. **Improvisation & Exploration:** Your college, friend, family member, or stranger is:

- **More worthy** of your trust when they help you explore and expand your ideas, uncover new possibilities, and refine them together.
- **Less worthy** of your trust when they dismiss your ideas, sticking rigidly to those already familiar to them, avoiding creative risks, and limiting exploration.

**Four Advanced Habits for Trustworthy Behavior**:

👉4. **Promise-keeping** Your college, friend, family member, or stranger is:

- **More worthy** of your trust when they keep her promises despite her high cost.
- **Less worthy** of your trust when they make promises she intends to break.

👉5. **Honesty:** Your college, friend, family member, or stranger is:

- **More worthy** of your trust when they tell you the truth despite her high cost.
- **Less worthy** of your trust when they intentionally lie to you when it serves their interests.

👉6. **Long-term thinking:** Your college, friend, family member, or stranger is:

- **More worthy** of your trust when they look decades ahead and consider the long-term effects of their actions
- **Less worthy** of your trust when they don’t look ahead and ignore the long-term effects of her actions.

👉7. **Moral development:** Your college, friend, family member, or stranger is:

- **More worthy** of your trust when they empower others to be more trustworthy.
- **Less worthy** of your trust when they ignore when people behave in an untrustworthy way.

# 3. How does it help you?

Consider the consequences of untrustworthy communication and behaviors:

1. How often do you personally experience **untrustworthy communication & behaviors** described in the seven statements above?
2. How often do you personally communicate or behave in an **untrustworthy** way?
3. How would **you feel** if your colleagues, friends, family members, and strangers behaved and communicated in a more trustworthy way, even with people they don't like or disagree with?
4. How would your colleagues, friends, family members, and strangers feel if **you communicated and behaved in a more trustworthy way**, even with people you don't like or disagree with?

**Untrustworthy communication and behaviors** lead to personal, social, and work challenges:

🛑 **Personal Challenges**

- Problems become harder to solve, mistakes accumulate, earning potential declines
- Self-doubt and mental blocks limit potential and growth.
- Soft skills—like active listening, negotiation, or collaboration—stagnate.

🛑 **Social Challenges**

- Relationships suffer when people violate the “silver rule,” treating others in ways they wouldn’t like to be treated themselves.
- Conflicts persist over what’s true or false, right or wrong.
- Misunderstanding becomes the norm, creating a spiral of isolation and disconnection.

🛑 **Work Challenges**

- Collaboration breaks down, knowledge-sharing and feedback loops disappear.
- Mistrust diminishes the collective problem-solving capacity.
- Instead of the best ideas winning, the loudest or most powerful voices dominate.

**Trustworthy communication and behaviors** lead to personal, social, and work benefits:

🔹**Personal Benefits**

1. Increase your problem-solving capacity and, as a result, your earnings potential
2. Reduce the number of mistakes you make
3. Overcome your mental blocks and challenges more effectively
4. Increase your objective trustworthiness
5. Improve your soft skills (e.g., active listening, communication, sales, negotiation, persuasion, critical thinking, and more)

🔹**Social Benefits**

1. Help the people close to you reduce the number of times they violate the Silver Rule by treating you in ways they wouldn’t want to be treated themselves.
2. Resolve epistemic conflicts (about what’s true and false) and moral conflicts (about what’s right or wrong) more effectively
3. Assess the objective trustworthiness of other people more effectively
4. Increase your capacity to trust others while minimizing the risk of being taken advantage of

🔹**Professional Benefits**

1. Exchange knowledge and feedback more effectively
2. Accelerate trust-building between members of small and large teams
3. Enhance the problem-solving capacity of small and large teams
4. Spread the culture of idea meritocracy where the best ideas win regardless of their source

🔹**Foundation for fulfilling universal human needs**

Trustworthy communication is more than just a set of skills. It’s the foundation of our happiness because it fulfills essential human needs, including:

1. **Need for Belonging** – Feeling truly heard and understood.
2. **Need for Respect** – Being valued for our ideas and contributions.
3. **Need for Growth** – Expanding our knowledge and seeing reality more clearly.

Despite the importance of these universal human needs, many people feel isolated, unheard, and misunderstood. Ironically, trustworthy communication doesn’t rely on scarce resources—it multiplies when given. The real challenge? Most people lack the habit of communicating trustworthy, making their relationships and lives increasingly difficult.
