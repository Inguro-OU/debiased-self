# War of Memes: A gamified debiasing method

Evil memes - patterns of thought and behavior - are humanity's greatest challenge. They cause division, harm, and turn people against each other. This gamified debiasing method empowers players to help each other eradicate these evil memes.

## Your Benefits

**Self**

1. Increase your financial gains and problem-solving capacity

**Communication**

4. Improve your soft skills (e.g., active listening, communication, sales, negotiation, persuasion, critical thinking, and more)
5. Reduce the number and severity of epistemic (true/false) and moral (right/wrong) conflicts
6. Receive and share knowledge and feedback more effectively

**Trustworthiness**
7. Increase your objective trustworthiness
8. Assess the objective trustworthiness of other people more effectively
9. Increase your capacity to trust others while minimizing the risk of others taking advantage of you 

**Collaboration**

10. Accelerate trust-building between members of a team
11. Enhance the problem-solving capacity of small and large teams
12. Foster a culture of idea meritocracy where the best ideas win regardless of the source

# Manifesto

## 1. Everyone Makes Mistakes

This universal truth is the foundation of effective debiasing: We all make mistakes. The most dangerous mistake is believing any idea, behavior, or cultural pattern cannot be wrong. Recognizing your own and other’s fallibility opens the door to continuous improvement.

## 2. Memes Live In Our Brains

A meme is a pattern of thought, behavior, or culture that spreads through human minds by imitation. Like genes in biological evolution, memes replicate, mutate, and compete for survival in the ecosystem of human minds. We naturally adopt memes from those we trust and admire, leading to their propagation through social networks. Understanding meme transmission is key to controlling their impact.

## 3. There Are No Evil People, Only Evil Memes

Memes vary in their fitness - their ability to survive and spread. The most dangerous memes combine high local fitness (benefiting individuals or small groups locally in time or locally in space) with low global fitness (harming humanity's long-term interests when widely adopted across space or durable in time). They persist and spread because they offer temporary high advantages for people who carry them at the cost of even greater disadvantages to the rest of humanity. This understanding shifts blame from individuals to the memes they carry in their brains.

## 4. Cognitive Biases Reinforce Evil Memes

Every person has more than 200+ cognitive biases - predictable judgment errors encoded in our brains through evolution. The most dangerous self-reinforcing triad is: 

1. Confirmation bias makes us seek evidence supporting our existing beliefs,
2. Myside bias evaluates evidence based on group identity rather than merit
3. Naïve realism convinces us we see objective reality while others are biased. 

These biases operate below conscious awareness and feel natural even as they strengthen harmful memes and resist correction.

## 5. Mistrust Is a Defense Against Evil Memes

Mistrust emerges as a natural defense against evil memes. The problem is that mistrust is a fundamental negative multiplier of our collective problem-solving capacity. It blocks new knowledge creation and effective knowledge sharing.

## 6. Debiasing Eradicates Evil

Debiasing systematically reduces cognitive biases' impact, addressing three fundamental challenges for humanity: 

1. The **Hard Problem of Cooperation** is the challenge of fostering cooperation between agents—**individuals** or **groups**—where each can gain at the expense of others. Each agent pursuing their **own interests** often leads to **collective failure**.
2. The **Tragedy of the Commons** occurs when individuals overuse **public goods** or shared resources for personal gain, depleting them for everyone. Each person acts rationally in their own short-term interest, but collectively, this behavior leads to resource collapse, harming all. 
3. The Tragedy of Rationality occurs when actions rational for agents—individuals or groups—lead to irrational outcomes for the collective. 

## 7. Debiasing Is a Human Right

Living with cognitive biases creates cascading harm:

- Individuals suffer through poor decisions
- Society is damaged through broken relationships
- Everybody suffers more because problems remain unresolved

Just as we recognize food security as a human right because hunger causes unnecessary suffering, we must recognize debiasing as a human right because cognitive biases cause unnecessary suffering. The cost of helping others debias is minimal compared to the massive benefits generated.

## 8. Vision: A World Where Violations of The Silver Rule Are Rapidly Decreasing

- **Our vision** is a world where violations of the Silver Rule-'Do not treat others in ways you don't want to be treated'- are increasingly rare, even between people accross different cultures and large distances."
- **Our goal** is to lower the cost of assessing Cognitive Trustworthiness - an individual's ability to act with moral and epistemic impartiality, demonstrated through trust behaviors like promise-keeping, active listening, critical thinking, transparency and long-term thinking. We also aim to increase incentives for people to increase their objective cognitive trustworthiness by allowing them to build lasting reputations and making adherence to the Silver Rule more beneficial than its violation.
- **Outcome**: As Cognitive Trustworthiness grows, individuals will more effectively correct their cognitive biases and prevent the spread of harmful patterns of thought and behavior ('evil memes'). Eradicating these evil memes more effectively will create a world of greater prosperity, happiness, progress, and equality.
