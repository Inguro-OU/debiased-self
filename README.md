**Debiasing Self** is a gamified **debiasing method** that helps individuals and teams uncover cognitive biases—predictable errors in judgment arising from our brains’ reliance on mental shortcuts. It fosters **cognitive empathy**, **intellectual humility**, **trustworthiness**, and **enhanced problem-solving capacity**. Players sharpen **active listening** and **critical thinking** skills through meaningful discussions and peer-initiated challenges while **exchanging knowledge** more effectively. Players collectively celebrate mistakes and grow closer to their **ideal, debiased selves**. **Debiasing Self** is adaptable to a variety of contexts, including:

- **Conflict Resolution** – Debiasing helps resolve conflicts by clarifying right vs. wrong and true vs. false.
- **Soft Skills, Sales, and Negotiation Training** – Debiasing enhances essential people-focused skills.
- **Self-Improvement** – Debiasing reduces distortions in how you perceive yourself, others, and reality.
- **Psychotherapy** – Debiasing aids in overcoming mental challenges and healing from past traumas.
- **Assess and Grow Cognitive Trust** – Use debiasing as a team-building tool and a way to evaluate cognitive trustworthiness.
- **Exchange Knowledge More effectively** – Debiasing make knowledge exchange more effective. In particular, it helps to give and receive feedback more effectively, reach better decisions, and reduce predictable errors.
- **Enhance Collective Problem-Solving** – Debiasing helps larger groups solve problems more effectively together.
