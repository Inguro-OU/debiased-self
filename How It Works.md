[README](https://github.com/Inguro-OU/debiased-self/blob/main/README.md) to learn more about the game, benefits, and background.

## **Flexible Setup**

1. **Casual 1-on-1:** Once familiar with the game, participants can play the game on the fly for constructive responses.
2. **Small Group:** A small group of participants can play while seated around a table. 
3. **Events with Free Movement:** In events of any size, players can move freely between groups and engage in one-on-one or small-group discussions.

## **Four Difficulty Levels**

The game offers four levels of play to suit different group sizes and complexities:

1. **Basic Level:** includes core rules for casual groups or first-time players.
2. **Intermediate Level:** adds structure with moderators and optional tools like idea cards. It is ideal for small groups around a table.
3. **Advanced Level:** includes expanded mechanics for deeper insights and competitive play. It is suitable for small groups of experienced players.
4. **Mastery Level:** for expert-level players who like to deepen their experience

## **Core Rules**

### **1. Voluntary Participation**

- **Game Badge**: Players wear a game badge to signal participation.
- **Opt-Out Anytime**: Players may remove their game badge to pause playing the game if they feel fatigued.

### **2. Armbands as Rewards**

- **Starting Supply**: Each player begins with five **armbands** in their hand. Armbands can be considered gifts from other players - they represent an opportunity for players to demand trustworthy communication from each other.
- **Anti-Hoarding Rule**: A player may hold a maximum of **10 armbands**. Players must donate extra armbands.

### **3. Initiate a Challenge**  
1. To encourage trustworthy communication, a player can call for a **challenge** by saying:  
- **"Listen Actively + [Name]"**  
- **"Think Critically + [Name]"**   
- **"Explore Creatively + [Name]"**  

2. The challenger places an **armband** on the table, signaling an opportunity to earn it.
3. The challenged player earns the **armband** if they successfully demonstrate the demanded behavior.
4. Reward Trustworthy Communication: if the behavior is demonstrated successfully, the challenger:  
- Gives the **armband** as recognition and says  **"Thank you + [Name]"**  

### 4. Lose an Armband for Perceived Untrustworthy Communication

A player can **lose an armband at any time** if another player **perceives** their communication as untrustworthy:

- If Player A perceives Player B as untrustworthy, Player A **calls it out.**
- Player B **must say sorry** and **give up one armband.**
- **Player B does NOT have to agree**—only acknowledges that their communication was perceived as untrustworthy.

✅ **Example:**

- *"I feel like you didn’t understand me."*
- *Player B must say: "Sorry for making you feel that way."*

⚠️ **Safeguard to Prevent Misuse**

- A player **cannot call out the same person repeatedly in a short period.**
- This prevents **overuse or weaponization** of the rule.


### **5. Voluntary Self-Challenge**

- Any player may **spontaneously challenge himself**.
- If the other player **perceives it as trustworthy communication**, they can reward the self-challenger with an **armband**.

## **Intermediate Rules (Optional)**

### **6. Idea Cards**

- A player draws a card from a shared game deck.
- The card introduces an **idea** for discussion. Players reflect, thinking (to themselves): “Which biases might I have?”

### **7. Declare Opinion**

- Players verbally declare their opinion on the card. There are only two options: **True or** **False.** Players can withhold declaring their opinion, indicating their uncertainty.
- If played at the table, the group can use **truth figures** and place them on the right option, expressing their opinion visually for others to see. Only one truth figure is allowed per player per idea card.

### **8. Explain Opinion**

- If all players agree on a given idea, they can move to the next card without explaining their opinion.
- If players disagree, each player has a set time (e.g., 1 minute) to explain the reasoning behind their opinion.
- Players can change their opinion anytime, which they celebrate with collective recognition (e.g., a clap) as a debiasing moment.

### **9. Moderator Role**

- Ensures **time limits** (e.g., 1 minute to explain an opinion, 2 minutes for active listening challenges).
- Resolves disputes and clarifies rules.
- Once experienced, moderators can improvise with topic-specific discussions, new game decks, and modified rules (e.g., as a warm-up before the game starts, players could celebrate sharing a recent past mistake while taking full responsibility for it without justifications).

---

## **Advanced Rules (Optional)**

### **10. Bring Your Deck**

- Players may create their own cards and bring them to the game.
- Each card’s backside may list the topic.
- Players can draw from another player’s rather than the main deck.
- Recommended tool: Use [Custom GPT to refine your ideas](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-676ec9d174608191a176779173a7a9e2-idea-refiner-for-war-of-memes) before writing them on a card.

### **11. Create Cards on the Fly**

- Players can express their ideas by writing them on a new card mid-game. We recommend that each player create a new card if they disagree with a given idea to explain their position in a short, clear way.
- Any card in play must have **at least one player** validating it as true. Otherwise, it goes to the **“Graveyard.”**
- Others can declare their opinion **True or False** (via truth figures or verbally).
- Players can choose whether to **allow** or **prohibit** their name from appearing on new cards (e.g., “Edward misunderstands confirmation bias”).
