# Manifesto

## 1. Everyone's Intuition Makes Mistakes

This universal truth forms the foundation of effective debiasing: human intuition is imperfect. We all make mistakes. The most perilous mistake is assuming that any person, organization, idea, behavior, or cultural pattern is beyond error. Acknowledging your own and others‚Äô fallibility paves the way for continuous learning and improvement.

## 2. What Is a Meme

Humans naturally copy behaviors, ideas, and patterns from each other‚Äîlike children imitating words or actions. This copying forms the basis of **memetic theory**, a scientific explanation of how culture spreads and evolves.

Most people think of ‚Äúmemes‚Äù as just jokes or GIFs. These are memes, but they‚Äôre only the most obvious examples‚Äîlike the bright and visible sun blinding us from seeing the stars. In this case, the stars are the countless memes we copy in daily life, big and small. Every interaction with another person involves memes: **words, ideas, behaviors, traditions, or even practical knowledge like driving a car or generating electricity.**

From our perspective, it feels like we actively choose to copy memes. But like in Einstein‚Äôs theory of relativity, there‚Äôs another way to see it: from the meme‚Äôs perspective. Memes ‚Äúmove‚Äù through the world, seeking survival. A useful meme‚Äîlike how to cook food or build a house‚Äîspreads because it helps people. A fun meme spreads by entertaining, like a joke or a dance. 

Like genes in biological evolution, memes replicate, mutate, and compete for attention and adoption in the ecosystem of human minds. We naturally adopt memes from those we trust and admire, leading to their propagation through social networks. Understanding meme transmission is key to controlling their impact.

## 3. There Are No Evil People, Only Evil Memes

From the meme‚Äôs perspective, the world is a playground where survival means being adopted and shared. Memes with **high fitness** spread easily, whether they benefit humanity (like the idea of human rights) or harm it (like false or harmful beliefs). Dangerous or ‚Äúevil‚Äù memes thrive when they offer short-term advantages to individuals or groups but harm humanity in the long run.

By understanding memes, we shift the blame from individuals to the harmful ideas and thoughts they carry. Mark Twain summed it up well: *‚ÄúThe problem isn‚Äôt that we know too little‚Äîit‚Äôs that we know things that aren‚Äôt true.‚Äù*

Mistrust emerges as a natural defense mechanism against people who might carry harmful or ‚Äúevil‚Äù memes. However, mistrust acts as a **negative multiplier** on our ability to solve problems together. It blocks the creation of new knowledge and sharing valuable ideas, leaving problems unsolved and suffering unaddressed.

## 4. Cognitive Biases Reinforce Evil Memes

Every person has more than 200+ cognitive biases - predictable judgment errors encoded in our brains through evolution. The most dangerous self-reinforcing triad is: 

1. Confirmation bias makes us seek evidence supporting our existing beliefs,
2. Myside bias evaluates evidence based on group identity rather than merit
3. Na√Øve realism convinces us we see objective reality while others are biased. 

These biases operate below conscious awareness and feel natural even as they strengthen harmful memes and resist correction.

## 5. How to Recognize Good Memes with Active Listening and Critical Thinking

Do you think these two statements below are `true` or `false`?

üëâ **Statement 1:** The same person is more **worthy of your trust** in case A rather than B:

- In case A, this person easily admits the possibility of being wrong, easily recognizes her mistakes, and willingly changes her opinion when presented with objectively better evidence.
- In case B, this person refuses to admit the possibility of being wrong, denies or ignores her mistakes, and clings to her opinions even when faced with objectively better evidence.‚Äù

üëâ **Statement 2:** The same person is more **worthy of your trust** in case A rather than B:

- In case A, this person gives you the feeling that she understands your perspective.
- In case B, this person doesn‚Äôt answer, breaks communication, and intentionally ignores your perspective

Like most people, you likely agree with both statements and see them as true. **Debiasing** is the process of peers helping each other act more like those in Case A‚Äîopen, constructive, and understanding‚Äîand less like those in Case B‚Äîreactive, dismissive, or defensive.

To recognize **good memes**, we must first cultivate two key traits: **cognitive empathy**‚Äîthe ability to understand others‚Äô perspectives‚Äîand **intellectual humility**‚Äîthe willingness to admit when we‚Äôre wrong and adapt to better evidence. These traits lead to behaviors like **active listening** and **critical thinking**, which are essential for evaluating memes.

**Falsification** is the process of actively trying to prove that a meme is **evil**‚Äîharmful or divisive. Instead of assuming a meme is **good**, we rigorously test it by looking for evidence of harm, misuse, or unintended consequences. If a meme withstands these efforts, it‚Äôs more likely to be **good**‚Äîhelpful and constructive.

## 6. Debiasing Is a Human Right

Humanity as a whole knows which memes are evil, but individuals often lack access to this collective wisdom. With good ideas and the right knowledge (memes), most of our problems are solvable.

Debiasing in the sense of eliminating evil memes is a human right. No one should be left to struggle with harmful biases alone. It‚Äôs our moral obligation‚Äîif we can, and it‚Äôs cost-effective‚Äîto help each other weed out bad ideas. 

Living with cognitive biases creates cascading harm:

- Individuals suffer through poor decisions
- Society is damaged through broken relationships
- Everybody suffers more because problems remain unresolved

Just as we recognize food security as a human right because hunger causes unnecessary suffering, we must recognize debiasing as a human right because cognitive biases cause unnecessary suffering. The cost of helping others debias is minimal compared to the massive benefits generated.

## 7. Vision: A World Where Violations of The Silver Rule Are Rapidly Decreasing

- **Our vision** is a world where violations of the Silver Rule‚Äî'Do not treat others in ways you don't want to be treated'‚Äîare increasingly rare, even among people across different cultures and large distances.
- **Our goal** is to lower the cost of assessing cognitive trustworthiness, an individual's ability to act with moral and epistemic impartiality, demonstrated through trust behaviors like promise-keeping, active listening, critical thinking, transparency, and long-term thinking. We also aim to increase incentives for people to increase their objective cognitive trustworthiness by allowing them to build lasting reputations and making adherence to the Silver Rule more beneficial than its violation.
- **Outcome**: As cognitive trustworthiness grows, individuals will more effectively correct their cognitive biases and prevent the spread of harmful patterns of thought and behavior ('evil memes'). Eradicating these evil memes more effectively will create a world of greater prosperity, happiness, progress, and equality.
